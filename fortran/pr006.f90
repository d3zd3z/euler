!
! The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
!
! 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
!
! The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
!
! (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
!
! Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten
! natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
!
! Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one
! hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
