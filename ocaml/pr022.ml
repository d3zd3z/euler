 * Problem 22
 *
 * 19 July 2002
 *
 *
 * Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 46K
 * text file containing over five-thousand first names, begin by
 * sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the
 * alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its
 * alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.
 *
 * For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN,
 * which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the
 * list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.
 *
 * What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
 *
 * 871198282
