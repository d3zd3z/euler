# It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom
# right diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13
# numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of
# 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.
#
# If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a
# square spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is
# continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for which
# the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?
