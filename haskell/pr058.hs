-- Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way,
-- a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.

-- 37 36 35 34 33 32 31
-- 38 17 16 15 14 13 30
-- 39 18  5  4  3 12 29

-- It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom
-- right diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the
-- 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio
-- of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.
--
-- If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a
-- square spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is
-- continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for which
-- the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?
