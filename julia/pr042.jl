# Problem 42
#
# 25 April 2003
#
#
# The n^th term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, t[n] = Â½n(n
# +1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:
#
# 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...
#
# By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its
# alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For
# example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t[10]. If the word
# value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.
#
# Using words.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K text
# file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, how many are
# triangle words?
