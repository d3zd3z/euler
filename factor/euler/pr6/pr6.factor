! The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
! 12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
!
! The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
! (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
!
! Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the
! first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’
! 385 = 2640.
!
! Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the
! first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
