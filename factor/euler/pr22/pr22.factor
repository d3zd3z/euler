! Problem 22
!
! 19 July 2002
!
!
! Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a
! 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names,
! begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out
! the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by
! its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.
!
! For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order,
! COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th
! name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53
! = 49714.
!
! What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
