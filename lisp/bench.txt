Some various benchmarks.

Euler problem 10:
sbcl:	      2.645	2.634	2.635
ccl64:	      7.48	7.39	7.37
ccl:	      7.998	7.960	8.064
ecl:	      14.464	14.449	14.400
abcl: 	      17.844	17.419	17.648
clisp:	      21.03	21.46	21.17

lispworks:    5.672	aborted personal edition

For a curious comparison, an algorithmically similar Go solution
go:   	      1.582	1.559	1.555

I've tried to keep the algorithm and data structures as similar as
possible between the Lisp and the Go solution.
