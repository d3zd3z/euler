;;; Problem 45
;;;
;;; 06 June 2003
;;;
;;; Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following
;;; formulae:
;;;
;;; Triangle     T[n]=n(n+1)/2    1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...
;;; Pentagonal   P[n]=n(3nâˆ’1)/2   1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...
;;; Hexagonal    H[n]=n(2nâˆ’1)     1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ...
;;;
;;; It can be verified that T[285] = P[165] = H[143] = 40755.
;;;
;;; Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.

;;; All Hexagonal numbers are Triangle numbers, so that isn't really useful.
;;; To get the nth pentagonal number P(n-1) + (3n-2)
;;; To get the nth hexagonal number H(n-1) + (4n-3)
