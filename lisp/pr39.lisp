;;; Problem 39
;;; 
;;; 14 March 2003
;;; 
;;; If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length
;;; sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.
;;; 
;;; {20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}
;;; 
;;; For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?
